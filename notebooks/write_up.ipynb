    "\n",
    "This project was inspired by my son during video calls with his grandparents in Florida (my mom and dad). He is an active little fellow, and I thought it would be neat if there was a way that a camera could track his movement and adjust position so my son would generally stay in frame. This way my hands would be free to play with him (instead of holding the phone just out of his reach).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since my phone does not have the capability to move on its own, I thought the next best thing would be a Raspberry Pi! For those who do not know, a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) is not only a delicious dessert, but it is also a tiny inexpensive computer, often described as \"about the size of a credit card\". When talking about the circuit board, this is accurate, but with all the components attached to it, and then put into a case, the size is closer to \"about the size of a 2-inch thick credit card\". \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I purchased this [CanaKit Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08956GVXN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) which boasts a 4-core processor and a whopping 8GB of RAM (where the previous Raspberry Pi a nd 3 only had 1GB of RAM). This version of the Raspberry pi utilizes a 64-bit CPU which allows use for a 64-bit OS, but with some caveats.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From past research I know the Raspberry Pi has camera capabilities, as well as something called a \"Pan-Tilt-Hat\" which the camera can be mounted to for movement. The \"Pan-Tilt-Hat\" is a circuit board that can sit atop the Raspberry Pi (like a hat, hence that part of the name), and it contains two servos that allow the device to pan horizontally, and tilt vertically. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From my research for this project, I found that I would need to install something called \"OpenCV\" which is a C/C++ based library that has a port to the Python programming language. This library seems to be __the__ library for anything involving object tracking and/or face detection.\n",

    "[(back to top)](#Face-Tracker-Project)\n",
    "\n",
    "With some help, I was able to download some training photos from Northeastern University's Augmented Cognition Lab's website. I trained a Keras model with these photos using Transfer Learning, but I later decided to abandon this route when I realized that I likely needed to freeze my Keras model in order to load it with OpenCV; A technique I am currently unfamiliar with. While this model scored well with the test set, I thought it may be the best to go another route since my son is now walking/running, and most of these images were infants crawling and laying down.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, I decided to instead use photos of my son that my wife and I had taken over the past year. These were easy to gather and were more accessible; and I thoroughly enjoyed looking through these photos to find a good set for annotating, training, testing, and validating. It was around this time I began to discover that there are many, many methods of saving, loading, and keeping neural net data, which typically involves a weights file and another file for the network architecture.\n",

Hopefully someone else finds it helpful. In summation, I bolted on the mechanism with the servos to the Pan-Tilt PCB, plugged the servos into the PCB, attached a face plate to the camera, and affixed the camera to the Pan-Tilt mechanism. Then I connected the Camera to the Raspberry Pi, and then the Pan-Tilt HAT.

Reasearching the best experieince with running OpenCV on Raspberry Pi, I decided to use the latest Raspbian OS.\n",

    "The [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/about/) (a UK registered Charity Organization) makes it very easy to [install your Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntaXWS8Lk34). You can download the Operating System image directly and flash your microSD card with Raspberry Pi's software or a software of your choice.

    "Flashing a microSD card is a very process, although it may sound intimidating. Typically this process is used for installing a Linux Operating System of one form or another, so you start by search for the Operating System of your choice. For instance, when I type \"Linux Image\" into Google, the first thing I see is a link to download Ubuntu, a version of Linux. Clicking on the link brings me to a page that has a prominent \"Download\" button.\n",

At this point, I plugged in my microSD card. After downloading the software, I ran [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/), selected the image I had just downloaded, selected the microSD card as my \"Drive\", and clicked \"Flash\", and ten minutes later my \"Solid-State-Drive\" for my Raspberry Pi was ready.

Raspberry pi has a useful and intuitive COnfiguration setup (both a GUI and in the terminal). By running `raspi-config` I was abel to easily navigate the menu and turn on these things, as well as VNC, and SSH.\n",

    "Although flashing a microSD card is very easy, it something I do not like to perform on the same card multiple times. Since microSD cards are a solid state drive device, they have limited read and write cycles. If anyone remembers listening to cassette tapes or watching VHS tapes, it is similar to how after much use your favorite cassette or VHS tape would start to degrade and not sound or look as good. However in this case, the microSD card just fails to work anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind I wanted to be very careful with my process. I later bought 5 more microSD cards just to be safe. I then used a tool named [Win32 Disk Imager](https://win32diskimager.download/) to make a backup image of my work in case my microSD card failed, so I had a backup and so I could quickly image a new card. Although I never had to use this, this would be very helpful since the OpenCV installation can take a while. In general, this is a good solution for backing up your environments; I was already using version control with Git to keeep all of my important work updated.\n",

I also ended up installing miniconda on the Raspberry Pi, but I never used the two modules together. So I ended up installing OpenCV and its dependencies twice, once for my \"cv\" `venv` environment and again for my \"opencv\" `conda` environment. In the end, my \"opencv\" `conda` environment waseasier to use with the Python files I was using and writing.
