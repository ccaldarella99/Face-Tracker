    "[(back to top)](#Face-Tracker-Project)\n",
    "\n",
    "This project was inspired by my son during video calls with his grandparents in Florida (my mom and dad). He is an active little fellow, and I thought it would be neat if there was a way that a camera could track his movement and adjust position so my son would generally stay in frame. This way my hands would be free to play with him (instead of holding the phone just out of his reach).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since my phone does not have the capability to move on its own, I thought the next best thing would be a Raspberry Pi! For those who do not know, a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) is not only a delicious dessert, but it is also a tiny inexpensive computer, often described as \"about the size of a credit card\". When talking about the circuit board, this is accurate, but with all the components attached to it, and then put into a case, the size is closer to \"about the size of a 2-inch thick credit card\". \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I purchased this [CanaKit Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08956GVXN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) which boasts a 4-core processor and a whopping 8GB of RAM (where the previous Raspberry Pi a nd 3 only had 1GB of RAM). This version of the Raspberry pi utilizes a 64-bit CPU which allows use for a 64-bit OS, but with some caveats.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From past research I know the Raspberry Pi has camera capabilities, as well as something called a \"Pan-Tilt-Hat\" which the camera can be mounted to for movement. The \"Pan-Tilt-Hat\" is a circuit board that can sit atop the Raspberry Pi (like a hat, hence that part of the name), and it contains two servos that allow the device to pan horizontally, and tilt vertically. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From my research for this project, I found that I would need to install something called \"OpenCV\" which is a C/C++ based library that has a port to the Python programming language. This library seems to be __the__ library for anything involving object tracking and/or face detection.\n",

    "[(back to top)](#Face-Tracker-Project)\n",
    "\n",
    "With some help, I was able to download some training photos from Northeastern University's Augmented Cognition Lab's website. I trained a Keras model with these photos using Transfer Learning, but I later decided to abandon this route when I realized that I likely needed to freeze my Keras model in order to load it with OpenCV; A technique I am currently unfamiliar with. While this model scored well with the test set, I thought it may be the best to go another route since my son is now walking/running, and most of these images were infants crawling and laying down.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, I decided to instead use photos of my son that my wife and I had taken over the past year. These were easy to gather and were more accessible; and I thoroughly enjoyed looking through these photos to find a good set for annotating, training, testing, and validating. It was around this time I began to discover that there are many, many methods of saving, loading, and keeping neural net data, which typically involves a weights file and another file for the network architecture.\n",

After downloading the software, I ran [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/), selected the image I had just downloaded, selected the microSD card as my \"Drive\", and clicked \"Flash\", and ten minutes later my \"Solid-State-Drive\" for my Raspberry Pi was ready.

Since microSD cards are a solid state drive device, they have limited read and write cycles. If anyone remembers listening to cassette tapes or watching VHS tapes, it is similar to how after much use your favorite cassette or VHS tape would start to degrade and not sound or look as good. However in this case, the microSD card just fails to work anymore.\n",

    "With this in mind I wanted to be very careful with my process. I later bought 5 more microSD cards just to be safe. I then used a tool named [Win32 Disk Imager](https://win32diskimager.download/) to make a backup image of my work in case my microSD card failed, so I had a backup and so I could quickly image a new card. Although I never had to use this, this would be very helpful since the OpenCV installation can take a while.

While possible, I found that a more linear train of thought was going to yield better results. \n",

    "In the end I ended up deleting and rewriting the pan-tilt code. I then used the coordinates to pan and tilt to build a boundary box in the middle of the screen (about three-fifths of the entire screen), and to continue detecting the face. I kept the OpenCV call to the Haar cascade .XML to look for a face. I then had the application check if any part of the box drawn by the Haar cascade classifier fell outside of the boundary box. If the facedetected was \"out of bound\", the pan-tilt mechanism would somewhat slowly move towards the face it detected on the screen, until it is back \"in bounds\".\n",

The paper outlined the use of something called a [Haar wavelet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haar_wavelet) for detecting objects (pictured above). At that time an issue in classifying objects with Computer vision was finding appropriate image representation. Generally, detecting edges did not always characterize the object class very well when trying to detect said object. \n",

    "What makes the use of Haar wavelets different is that instead of relying on motion detection only, this method uses the 2D Haar wavelets for edge detection and then shifts the wavelet in each direction across an image which allows this method to quickly capture facial features. The model was then trained to find the relationships between only the most important observations using a support vector machine (SVM). \n",

In this paper Viola and Jones outline the use of similar Haar wavelets (pictured above, a two-rectangle and a three-rectangle feature). Here, Viola and Jones sum the pixels in the white rectangles and subtract them from the sum of the pixels in the black triangle, thus using features instead of directly using the pixels. This approach is much faster and is also very good at finding some properties common to human faces: 1.) The upper-cheeks are lighter than the eye region, and 2.) The eye region is darker than the bridge of the nose. This can be seen in the picture above. \n",
